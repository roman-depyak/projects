                        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                        <p>My career goals are to combine my experience working in medicine with my love of computer science.
                            I have been working in the medical field since 2017. Recently I had the opportunity to try coding at work and I fell in love with it!
                            After graduating from university I plan on combining my knowledge of medicine with computer science by working for a healthcare or healthcare adjacent company. 
                            Some examples of this could be helping to develop code for an EMR such as Epic. At present I am keeping my options open, and I would like to experience all facets of computer science so I can find a career that I love.

                        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                        <p>
                            The technologies used in this website include Express, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, and React.
                            Node is a JavaScript runtime environment which allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of a web browser. 
                            Express is a framework for JavaScript and is hosted in the Node runtime environment. MongoDB is a database system
                            that allows for storing and managing data. Mongoose is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to manage, 
                            organize, and work with the data stored in the MongoDB database. React is a framework for writing frontend
                            applications. Together MongoDB, Express, React, and Node are referred to as MERN; MERN is a technology stack used 
                            for building scalable web applications.
